# TurnDiff
A tunable-generalization diffusion framework for Low-Dose CT (LDCT) reconstruction. TurnDiff leverages self-supervised contextual sub-data in the projection domain to generate priors and employs a pixel-level self-correcting fusion strategy to achieve robust denoising across varying dose levels without paired data.
